            The Supreme Court heard two cases Tuesday about whether
            states can bar transgender athletes from participating in
            sports that align with their gender rather than their assigned sex as birth.

                Transgender rights activists arguing in favor of integration argue
                that the disputed state bans not only violate federal anti-bias statutes
                but also directly contradict the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of equal protection
                under the Fourteenth Amendment.

                Meanwhile, opponents of integration argue that allowing transgender athletes to participate in
                sports that align with their gender would give them unfair advantages,
                impacting cisgender people's opportunities to succeed.
